	    <p>The <b>Election Polling Places</b> application helps citizens locate their election polling place, comment on conditions at the polling place, and obtain information about current elected officials. This application is typically used by citizens during an election season, but can be used throughout the year to determine which elected official represents the precinct they reside in.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The Election Polling Places application offers a simple way for voters to find their election polling place. When a voter finds their address, the application will select the appropriate polling place and highlight it, along with the respective voting precinct, on the map.  In addition, relevant information about that polling place and currently elected officials will be presented in a series of tabs at the bottom of the application.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a address when you've located it. You can also use your current location or finally search for an address to find your polling place.</p>
